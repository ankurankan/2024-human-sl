1. Comparisons between different algorithms in the simulation study.

2. We would like to clarify that Algorithm 1 is slightly different than how we
expect the user to use the method in practice. For the purpose of the analysis,
Algorithm 1 considers a fully automated scenario where all the edges
corresponding to the unexplained association need to be added (and hence we
have to add a reverse edge to avoid the cycle). In practice, if a user reaches a
scenario where adding an edge creates a cycle in the DAG, it implies that they
have made some mistakes earlier and ideally they would backtrack their changes
to identify and fix the mistakes. We do not have any systematic approach for
this backtracking yet as we mention in the Conclusion section of the paper.

As pointed by Reviewer yVjw as well, the difference in the automated versions
as presented in the Algorithms and how we expect the user to use the method is
not clear from the paper. We will revisions to the Introduction and Section 3
and 4 to make this clearer.

3. As we can see in Figure 5, if we continue to follow the suggestions from the
method, it leads to continuous improvements in the fit of the model, so a user
can choose to stop at any point. We can additionally use the total residual
association measure to quantify how well the current model explains the data.

4. Thanks for pointing this out, we agree and we will mention it in the paper.

5. We agree that the CI tests considered here assume Gaussian variables and
underlying latent Gaussian variables for ordinal variables. We will add these
assumptions to the paper. We have not considered a mix of continuous and
nominal categorical variables as we are not aware of any CI test with a measure
of association for this combination.

6. We will clarify the setting in which the Age variable is considered here (i.e.,
the adult income dataset) where we do not expect any edges going into it as
some of automated algorithms learn in Figure 1.

TODO: Not sure how to respond to this. Any variable that we choose as an example can
be made endogenous if we consider it in a specific setting.

7. The approach only requires the user to correctly specify ancestral
relationships but is still able to distinguish between direct and indirect
effects. If we consider a simple mediation model example, X -> M -> Y and lets
say we start with an empty graph and the user first adds the edge X -> Y. The
DAG would still have unexplained association between X and M, and Y and M.
Based on this the user can then add the edges X -> M and M -> Y, after which
the pruning step would remove the original X -> Y edge.

The green and black edges in Figure 7 shows the current edges in the DAG. The
red edges show the pair of variables that still have unexplained association
with the strength shown using the edge's thickness. In each step, the user can
choose a pair of variables connected through a red edge (ideally the one with
the highest unexplained association) and add an edge between based on their
domain knowledge. At each iteration, the tool also presents unnecessary edges
in the DAG in black that the user can remove.

We will improve the caption of Figure 7 to make it clearer what the different edges
represent.

8. As our method is supposed to be used to assist in manual DAG construction by
showing potential modifications to the DAG, the user is free to overrule/ignore
any suggestion made by the method. Even in such scenarios when the expert
disagrees with a suggestion, the method would still be helpful as it would
highlight that the data does not agree with the expert knowledge.

9. The total residual association should be score equivalent as they are the
product of the effect sizes of all the implied CIs of a given DAG. As all the
DAGs in a MEC implies the same set of CI statements, the total residual
association should be the same.

10. 

11. Thank you for pointing that out. It is indeed true, we will mention it in the paper.

12. Thank you for pointing this out. We will revise the statement to: ".. expert is able to correctly identify the relationship in more than .."

13a. In Algorithm 1, $ (V, E) $ represents the current graph and $ D_G $ makes d-separation queries on the true unknown graph.

13b. We will add another step here to check whether $ e $ is None, and lines 7-11 should be executed only when $ e $ is not None.

13c. That is indeed a mistake and it should be "go to line 17".

13d.

14-21. Typos and language issues: Thank you for pointing these out, we will fix them.

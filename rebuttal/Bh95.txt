1. Mistakes due to unreliable CI tests.

It is true that the mistakes made by constraint-based causal discovery
arise due to difficulties in CI testing. But multiple previous methods have
shown that expert knowledge can be used to improve the results of these
automated causal discovery methods [1][2]. 

However as researchers in practice do not use any causal
discovery algorithms and prefer to construct the DAGs based only on their
expert knowledge, we here present a method that can assist them in this
process. The solution that approach offers is a middle ground between these
completely automated algorithms and a completely manual approach where the
manual construction approach is augmented using the available data. The
automated algorithms make decision about keeping the edge or removing them
automatically based on the CI test, here we put an expert to make this decision
and they can override the results of CI tests using their domain expertise.
Other methods for causal discovery that use expert knowledge kind of aim for
this same thing where the expert can for example specify required edges or
forbidden edges in the final model. Our approach instead provides a more
fine-grained control to the researchers while also letting them know the
consequences of their decision (for example through unexplained correlations).
For example some observed correlation is an artifact of the way data was
collected but should not be present in the true causal model.

We will modify our introduction such that this message is clearer.

2. Lack of theoretical analysis on the behavior of the method when the domain
expert is incorrect.

We do not think there is any straightforward way to perform the theoretical
analysis for a given accuracy level of the ancestral oracle or the d-separation
oracle. However, this is common issue with most of the causal discovery
algorithms and we usually have to rely on some oracle assumptions to prove
their correctness. For example PC algorithm and its variants assumes that we
have a conditional independence test oracle and score based algorithms assumes
a consistent scoring method. In our paper, we have provided a correctness proof
under the assumption of an ancestral oracle and a d-separation oracle, and our 
empirical analysis tests for the violations of these assumptions.

3. Using residual association to prioritize modifications to the DAG.

Indeed the residual association for a CI test $ X \ci Y | \bm{Z} $ measures the
conditional association between the variables $ X $ and $ Y $ conditioned on $
\bm{Z} $. In our case, given a DAG, $G$, if there is no edge between $ X $ and
$ Y $ and $ Z = pa_G(X) \cup pa_G(Y) $, then the residual association can be
interpreted as the observed association between the variables $ X $ and $ Y $
in our data that is \textbf{not explained} by our current DAG. The strength of
this conditional association then gives us a measure of how bad the unexplained
association is, and hence we use it as a measure to rank modifications.

Thank you for pointing these out, we will fix them.

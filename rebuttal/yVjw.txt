1. Clarity in describing the algorithm.

We are considering a single approach. As most researchers construct DAGs
manually, the goal of the presented approach is to assist researchers in this
manual construction process. In each iteration, our proposed approach finds
potential modifications to the DAG such that the model becomes more consistent
with the data. Using this information the user can choose the most suitable
modification to make (and decide edge orientation if adding an edge).

In Section 4, to simulate an expert we have considered a variant of this above
approach, where in each iteration the expert chooses the highest ranked edge
addition in each iteration.

We will make this distinction clearer in Section 4 of the paper.

2. Overlooked Kitson 2025.

We did miss that paper. Their approach proposes a modification to the tabu
search algorithm where the algorithm prompts the user for information when the
score improvement is not significant.

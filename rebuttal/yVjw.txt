1. Clarity in describing the algorithm.

We are considering a single approach. The goal of this approach is to augment
the manual DAG construction usually done by domain experts. We do this by
showing potential modifications to the experts using data where they can make
the choice of adding/removing edges and their orientation. For the theoretical
and empirical analysis, we need an algorithmic procedure to simulate this model
construction process and for that we choose to always make modifications to the
pair of variables with the highest unexplained correlation. In practice, the
expert can use this information to help them in making a choice but are not
obliged to always select this pair of variable first.

We will make this distinction clearer in Section 3 and 4 of the paper.

2. Overlooked Kitson 2025.

We did miss that paper. Their approach proposes a modification to the tabu
search algorithm where the algorithm prompts the user for information when the
score improvement is not significant.

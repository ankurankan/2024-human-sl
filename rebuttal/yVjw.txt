We would like to thank the reviewer for taking the time to review our work and the
valuable comments. Below, we provide responses to each concern.

1. Clarity in describing the algorithm.

We are presenting a single approach throughout the paper. Since most
researchers manually construct DAGs using their domain knowledge, the goal of
our proposed method is to assist them in this process by offering an
interactive, data-driven tool. Our proposed method uses data to identify and
rank potential modifications to the current DAG, either by adding an edge or
removing an existing edge to improve consistency with the data. In each
iteration, these suggestions are presented to the user, who ultimately chooses
the modification to make allowing them to integrate their domain expertise in
the model building process. This approach allows for the expert to remain in
control while guiding the model building process through insights from data.

In Section 4, for the purpose of evaluation, we simulate an expert by assuming
that the expert always select the highest-ranked modification in each iteration
(Algorithm 4). This is a slightly different setup compared to how we expect the
tool to be used in practice.

We will make revisions in the Introduction and Section 4 to make the goal of
the presented approach and the assumption made for empirical evaluation
clearer.

2. Overlooked related work (Kitson, 2025).

Thank you for pointing us to the work by Kitson et al. (2025), which we indeed
missed.

While both our method and Kitson (2025) propose interactive approaches to
causal discovery, the intended goal and the method differs. Kitson (2025)
modifies a score-based method and selectively prompts the user for input when
the algorithm is uncertain -- such as in cases of tied score improvement or
low-confidence modifications. In contrast, our approach is designed to assist
users in manual DAG construction by presenting them with a ranked list of
potential modifications in each iterations. As the user always makes the choice
of these modifications, they maintain full control on the changes being made
and when to stop the process. In this way, our method places greater emphasis on
expert-driven model construction compared to Kitson (2025).

We will revise the Conclusions section to acknowledge Kitson (2025) and include
the differences between the two approaches.

1. Clarity in describing the algorithm.

We are considering a single approach. As most researchers construct DAGs
manually, the goal of our approach is to assist these researchers in this
manual DAG construction. Our proposed approach is an interactive way to this
manual model construction where our method uses the data to identify and rank
potential modifications to the DAG such that it is more consistent to the data.
These potential modifications can either be adding an edge between two
variables or removing an existing edge. Using this information the researcher
are free to choose which modification they want to make, or stop at any point
where they are satisfied with the model.

In Section 4, to simulate an expert we assume that the expert always first
chooses the highest ranked modification in each iterations

We will make this clearer in Section 3 and Section 4.

2. Overlooked Kitson 2025.

We did miss that paper. Their approach proposes a modification to the tabu
search algorithm where the algorithm prompts the user for information when the
score improvement is not significant.

We would like to thank the reviewer for taking the time to review our work and the
valuable comments. Below, we provide responses to each concern.

1. Discussion of related work

While previous work has explored incorporating expert knowledge through
specifying constraints through fixed/forbidden edges[1] or temporal ordering[2]
in automated causal discovery algorithms, our approach differs by providing an
interactive method for integrating expert knowledge. While writing this paper
we were not aware of any other work that explored a similar setting, however
Reviewer yVjw pointed us to the paper by Kitson et al. (2025) which considered
similar interactive user input but with a very different approach.

We acknowledge this oversight and will include a discussion of this related
work in our Conclusions section.

2. Potential overfitting due to residual associations.

We agree that overfitting can be a concern when relying on residual
associations, as in finite samples many small conditional associations may
exist. In practice, we address this by a tunable threshold on the conditional
association, below which potential modifications are ignored. This threshold is
implemented in both the web-based tool and is used for the empirical
evaluations presented in the paper. Moreover the tradeoff between precision and
recall is usually dependent on the context [3], hence the threshold can also be
used to tune the method to the required setting.

We will add a discussion on overfitting in the Conclusions section of our paper.

3. Assumptions such as sufficiency and faithfulness.

As with many causal discovery methods, our approach assumes the Causal Markov
Condition, faithfulness, and causal sufficiency. While we mention in Section 2
that we assume all variables to be observed (implying sufficiency), we agree
that these assumptions should be stated more explicitly.

We will explicitly state these assumptions at the beginning of Section 3.

4. The notation $ D_G(X, Y, Z) = 0 $.

In Section 3.1, we define $ D_G(X, Y, Z) = 1 $ when $ X $ and $ Y $ are
d-separated by $ Z $ in G. Similarly, $ D_G(X, Y, Z) = 0 $ when $ X $ and $ Y $
are d-connected conditioned on $ Z $ in $ G $. 

We will move this definition to the notations paragraph in Section 2 and clarify
the notation for both $ D_G = 0 $ and $ D_G = 1 $.

5. Proof of Proposition 2.

We do not consider unobserved confounding.

6. Purpose of Section 3.3.

As the proposed approach is very similar to the GES algorithm and constructs
the model in two phases: adding edges and pruning edges similar to GES, we
wanted to highlight the differences between the two approaches in this section.

We would like to thank the reviewer for taking the time to review our work and the
valuable comments. Below, we provide responses to each concern.

1. Discussion of related work

While there are other approaches to integrating expert knowledge in causal
discovery such as specifying forbidden or fixed edges[1] or specifying temporal
order[2] for the variables, our work was the first to have an interactive
approach towards causal discovery. Reviewer yVjw has, however, pointed us 
to another paper that considers a similar interactive approach. We will add
reference and discussion on the differences between the two approaches.

2. Discussion on the potential overfitting issues with the proposed method.

Overfitting can indeed be an issue in practice with this approach as there can
be many small residual association between the variables. In practice, as built
into the web tool and used in the empirical analysis, we suggest using a
association threshold value that would ignore any conditional association below
the threshold value. Given that the choice of overfitting can be dependent on
the context of the problem statement [3], the threshold value gives a way to 
control to get the desired output.

We will add a discussion on overfitting in the Conclusions section of our paper.

3. Strong assumptions such as sufficiency, and faithfulness assumptions.

Our approach makes the assumptions of faithfulness and causal sufficiency
similar to most algorithms for causal discovery. We do mention in Section 2
that we only consider the setting where all variables to be observed implying
causal sufficiency. But we do agree that these assumptions can be make clearer
in the paper and we will do that.

4. The notation $ D_G(X, Y, Z) = 0 $.

In Section 3.1, we define $ D_G(X, Y, Z) = 1 $ when $ X $ and $ Y $ are
d-separated by $ Z $ in G. Similarly, $ D_G(X, Y, Z) = 0 $ when $ X $ and $ Y $
are d-connected conditioned on $ Z $ in $ G $. We will move this definition to
the notation paragraph in Section 2 and clarify the notation for both $ D_G = 0 $ and
$ D_G = 1 $.

5. Proof of Proposition 2.

We do not consider unobserved confounding.

6. Purpose of Section 3.3.

As the proposed approach is very similar to the GES algorithm and takes the
same two steps as first adding edges to the model and then doing a pruning step
to remove unnecessary edge, our goal with Section 3.3 was to highlight the
difference between the two approaches.

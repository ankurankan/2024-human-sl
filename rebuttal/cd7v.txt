1. Discussion of related work

While there are other approaches to integrating expert knowledge in causal
discovery such as specifying forbidden or fixed edges or specifying temporal
order for the variables, this was the first work towards an interactive
approach towards causal discovery. However, another reviewer has pointed out to
a very recent work where the paper also considers an interactive expert
knowledge specification approach that we missed. We will provide a reference
and discussion of the difference between the two approaches.

2. Discussion on the potential overfitting issues with the proposed method.

Overfitting can indeed be an issue in practice with this approach as there can
be many correlations between the variables. The association threshold can be
used as a way to control the density of the final models. As depending on the
application or dataset, the user might want a more denser or sparser model[1],
the threshold values gives a way to control this.

3. Strong assumptions such as sufficiency, and faithfulness assumptions.

Our approach makes the same assumptions as most standard algorithms for causal
discovery make faithfulness and causal sufficiency. We do mention in Section 2
that we consider all variables to be observed but we will make these
assumptions clearer.


4. The notation $ D_G(X, Y, Z) = 0 $.

In Section 3.1, we define $ D_G(X, Y, Z) = 1 $ when $ X $ and $ Y $ are
d-separated by $ Z $ in G. Similarly $ D_G(X, Y, Z) = 0 $ when $ X $ and $ Y $ 
are d-connected conditioned on $ Z $ in $ G $. We will move this definition to 
our notation section and clarify both the $ 0 $ and $ 1 $ values.

5. Proof of Proposition 2.

We do not consider unobserved confounding.

6. Purpose of Section 3.3.

As the proposed approach is very similar to the GES algorithm and takes the
same two steps: Expand is equivalent to Add and Reduce is equivalent to Remove
in case of GES, we wanted to highlight the differences between the two
approaches.

This introduction to the use of graphical models in the description and modeling of multivariate systems covers conditional independence, several types of independence graphs, Gaussian models, issues in model selection, regression and decomposition. Many numerical examples and exercises with solutions are included.This book is aimed at students who require a course on applied multivariate statistics unified by the concept of conditional independence and researchers concerned with applying graphical modelling techniques.}

abstract = {Equivalence classes of DAGs (represented by CPDAGs) may be too large to provide useful causal information. Here, we address incorporating tiered background knowledge yielding restricted equivalence classes represented by 'tiered MPDAGs'. Tiered knowledge leads to considerable gains in informativeness and computational efficiency: We show that construction of tiered MPDAGs only requires application of Meek's 1st rule, and that tiered MPDAGs (unlike general MPDAGs) are chain graphs with chordal components. This entails simplifications e.g. of determining valid adjustment sets for causal effect estimation. Further, we characterise when one tiered ordering is more informative than another, providing insights into useful aspects of background knowledge.},
